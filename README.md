Intel Sustainability Impact SQL Analysis
Overview

Conducted a SQL-based sustainability impact analysis using a simulated Intel device repurposing dataset to evaluate energy savings and CO₂ reductions across device types, age groups, and regions. This project demonstrates advanced SQL joins, aggregation, segmentation, and data-driven strategic insight generation.

Dataset

The dataset represents devices repurposed in 2024 and includes:

Device-level metadata (device type, model year)

Environmental impact metrics (energy savings, CO₂ saved, recycling rate)

Usage purpose classification

Regional segmentation (Asia, Europe, North America)

The dataset is simulated for educational purposes and reflects the structural characteristics of real-world sustainability data.

Key Questions Answered

How many devices were repurposed in 2024?

What is the total energy and CO₂ savings impact?

Do laptops or desktops drive greater environmental impact?

How does environmental impact vary by device age?

Which regions generate the highest CO₂ savings per device?

What strategic improvements could maximize sustainability outcomes?

Skills & Tools

SQL (SELECT, JOIN, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, WITH / CTE)

Aggregation (COUNT, AVG, SUM)

CASE statements for cohort engineering

CO₂ unit conversion and impact modeling

Data-driven sustainability strategy recommendations

Key Insights

601,740 devices were repurposed in 2024.

Total annual CO₂ reduction exceeded 6,700 metric tons.

Older devices (>6 years) produced significantly higher per-device environmental impact.

Laptops drove the majority of overall savings due to higher repurposing volume.

Asia demonstrated the highest CO₂ savings per device due to higher regional carbon intensity.

Strategic targeting of older devices in high-carbon regions could maximize environmental impact.
